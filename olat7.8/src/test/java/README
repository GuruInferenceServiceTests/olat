Junit testing
-----------------------------------

o INTEGRATION testing: Write your test code extending from OlatTestCase and a whole OLAT will be started for you.
	The database will be an hsqldb in memory only database which will not be persisted and will only last for the duration of a test.
	This kind of tests take some time to run as they start the whole framework. This is considered a bad practice and will no longer be possible
	in Future.

o TRUE UNIT TESTING: write your testcode extended by AbstractJUnit4SpringContextTests and only 
	add the spring context you need
	- see test/java/org/olat/test/SpringTest.java for an example
	
o Right Click a Test and say: Run as Unit test to run a Test.

pitfalls: If you get an exception that some files are not found make sure your classpath does include all types of files
for src/test/java and not only java files. Right click->Properties->Java Build Path.
