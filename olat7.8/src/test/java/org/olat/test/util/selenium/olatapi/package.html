OLAT Abstraction Layer API.
<br/>
This represents a hierarchical object model (OLATSeleniumWrapper objects) of the 
OLAT's sub-workflows, and encapsulates the selenium commands succession in an API. 
The application layer classes are design based on the GUI pages structure. 
The implementation status of this API reflects the current needs of the existing 
tests (clients), that is only the minimum is implemented to fulfil the demands of 
the tests cases. 
<br/>
Another limitation of this API is that is role independent. 
This means that the test developer has to keep in mind that the API is designed 
from the administrator perspective. 
<br/>
Ideally all tests cases should contain no selenium commands but only calls to the 
Abstraction Layer API.
